# 🌤️ Weather App (Python)

This is a simple command-line weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🔧 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter a city name.
- Sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays current weather, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## ▶️ Usage

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script:
```bash
python weather.py
```
Enter a city name (capitalize the first letter, e.g., London).

🔑 Note
You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Replace the API_KEY in weather.py with your key.
